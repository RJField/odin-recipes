    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        After making some atoms move in a groovy microwave rave for a few minutes (please refer to package instruction), you will end up with a deceivingly hot yet undercooked slob of over processed and machine regurgitated ... food.

    <h2>Destructions</h2>
    <p>
        But don't worry, it's <b>precision engineered</b> to hit your cravings and keep them coming back for more!<br>
        And so you'll come back for more as well!
